# Vault Rebalancer

**Status:** Draft
**Owner:** @Jordan Ribbink

A Cadence resource that pokes a single Solidity function on an interval via [`FlowTransactionScheduler`](https://github.com/onflow/flips/blob/main/protocol/20250609-scheduled-transactions.md) (FLIP 330).

## Assumptions

- **EVM-side errors don't panic the scheduled tx.** `coa.call` surfaces revert/OOG as a non-successful `EVM.Result`, never as a Cadence panic. The failure model rests on this — without it, an EVM revert would abort the scheduled tx before it can self-reschedule, killing the chain.
- **Off-chain tick liveness monitoring exists.** A tick-aborting failure (unborrowable cap, insufficient FLOW, storage-min, out-of-effort) emits no event and surfaces only as a missing `Ticked` (an EVM-call failure, by contrast, is reported in the `Ticked` it emits). Operators must observe staleness and trigger recovery before LTV drifts to liquidation.

## What we require from the EVM contract

- **`rebalance()` is idempotent and self-guarding** — it inspects vault state and either acts or no-ops.
- **`rebalance()` is permissionless** — callable by any EOA.
- **The COA's EVM-side authority is narrow** — restricted to invoking `rebalance()` only (no admin or fund-movement entrypoints). This bounds the blast radius of an admin-compromised config rewrite to liveness impact.

## Design

One Cadence resource per EVM target, owned by an admin account. Stored at a deterministic path derived from the EVM target address.

- Holds a `Capability<auth(EVM.Call) &EVM.CadenceOwnedAccount>` — the EVM caller identity used to invoke `rebalance()`.
- Identity config (target address, calldata, scheduler priority) is immutable; changing any requires destroy + recreate. Tunable config (tick interval, EVM gas limit, execution effort) is mutable via an admin-entitlement-gated setter per field.
- On each tick: `coa.call(...)` against the EVM contract; emit one event for the EVM-side outcome; self-reschedule via `FlowTransactionScheduler.schedule(...)` with the current config.
- Self-rescheduling failures (insufficient FLOW, storage-minimum breach, scheduler rejection, Cadence out-of-effort) revert the whole tick — including the committed EVM call — with no event; they are detectable only as a missing `Ticked`. There is intentionally no in-band failure event: the set of failure conditions is open-ended (FLIP-330 does not preserve the tick on out-of-effort), so detection is by liveness, not by enumeration. The restart entry point is permissionless and idempotent — anyone can resume scheduling once the underlying condition is resolved.

**Scheduler priority.** The rebalancer uses Medium: it defers under slot contention but never rejects at submission (see *Scheduler availability* below).

**Effort and gas sizing.** EVM `gasLimit` bounds the EVM call's worst-case cost; the Cadence `executionEffort` budget is sized to cover that bound plus the self-reschedule tail, with margin skewed larger on the Cadence side. EVM out-of-gas just fails the EVM call (surfaced as a non-successful `EVM.Result`) and the next tick retries, but Cadence out-of-effort would abort the entire scheduled tx atomically — including the EVM call — stopping the chain. Values are calibrated from measured worst-case `rebalance()` cost and must be re-tuned if governance changes Cadence execution-effort weights. The self-reschedule tail also includes an internal slot search under Medium-priority contention whose effort consumption grows with distance to the next free slot; margin must accommodate this on top of the EVM call's worst-case cost (see *Scheduler availability*).

**Scheduler availability.** `FlowTransactionScheduler` is best-effort under slot contention — sustained contention can delay the next tick or temporarily halt the self-reschedule loop until manually restarted. Damage is bounded to liveness; the canonical recovery is direct (permissionless) `rebalance()` invocation on the EVM contract. Off-chain tick liveness monitoring is required.

## Failure modes and recovery

| Failure | Observable | Recovery |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| EVM call fails, transient (slippage, momentary state, out-of-gas) | Tick event with EVM error code | Next tick retries automatically; persistent OOG requires admin to raise the EVM gas limit |
| EVM call fails, sustained (role revoked EVM-side, persistent Solidity-side condition) | Tick event repeats with non-zero error code N ticks in a row | Admin addresses EVM-side condition (restore role, resolve Solidity state) |
| Fee vault depletion / storage-min breach (Cadence scheduling fees) | No event; absence of `Ticked` triggers the liveness alert | Admin tops up; signs tx to re-invoke self-reschedule |
| COA FLOW depletion (EVM-side gas) | Tick events repeat with non-zero EVM error code; off-chain balance script catches drift earlier | Anyone can send FLOW to the COA (permissionless, from either Cadence or EVM) |
| Cadence-side OOE (effort margin too tight) | Absence of expected events for the scheduled tx; rebalancer stops ticking | Admin re-invokes self-reschedule; retune effort margin if recurring |
| Sustained scheduler unavailability | Tick events absent or persistently delayed; tick liveness monitor alerts | Anyone invokes `rebalance()` directly on the EVM contract; permissionless restart resumes ticking once contention clears |

**Failure scope.** No single failure causes immediate solvency loss; failures degrade first to liveness. Prolonged outage can drift LTV and trigger Morpho liquidation under adverse prices, on a horizon set by market parameters and volatility — not by this design. Note the revert-causing failures (depleted fee vault, storage-minimum breach, out-of-effort) correlate with market stress, so a tick can discard a just-committed delever when LTV is closest to liquidation; the v0.x mitigation is off-chain absence-of-`Ticked` monitoring plus the permissionless direct `rebalance()` backstop. Decoupling the work from loop-maintenance (see *Future scope*) is the structural fix and is the immediate follow-up.

## Deployment

Deployment is **manual** and targets Flow mainnet directly, mirroring the EVM
side (see the root README). The contract is owned by a deployer account
configured in the `flow.mainnet.json` overlay — kept separate from the base
`flow.json` so `flow test` / `make ci` never require the deployer's env vars.

Set the deployer credentials (the account becomes the resource owner and pays
scheduling fees):

```bash
export FLOW_DEPLOYER_ADDRESS=0x…           # Flow account address
export FLOW_DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=…         # ECDSA_P256 / SHA3_256, key index 0
```

The three steps, each with a `-dry` variant that runs against a local emulator
forked from live mainnet state — **always dry-run first**. Start the fork in a
separate terminal:

```bash
make mainnet-fork-emulator                 # flow emulator --fork mainnet
```

Then, against `--network mainnet-fork` (`-dry`) or real `--network mainnet`:

```bash
# 1. Publish the VaultRebalancer contract.
make mainnet-deploy-rebalancer-dry
make mainnet-deploy-rebalancer

# 2. Create the Rebalancer resource targeting the FCMVault. VAULT is the
#    FCMVault EVM address; calldata is hardcoded to rebalance(false) and the
#    scheduler priority to Medium. Size the tunables to the measured worst-case
#    rebalance() cost (see Effort and gas sizing above).
make mainnet-setup-rebalancer-dry VAULT=0x… TICK_INTERVAL=3600.0 EVM_GAS_LIMIT=200000 EXECUTION_EFFORT=20000
make mainnet-setup-rebalancer     VAULT=0x… TICK_INTERVAL=3600.0 EVM_GAS_LIMIT=200000 EXECUTION_EFFORT=20000

# 3. Kick off the self-rescheduling tick loop (permissionless, idempotent).
make mainnet-schedule-rebalancer-dry VAULT=0x…
make mainnet-schedule-rebalancer     VAULT=0x…
```

The deployer account must hold enough FLOW to cover the per-tick scheduling fee
plus the account storage minimum; depletion halts the loop (see *Failure modes*).

## Future scope

Possible evolutions of this design — none load-bearing for v0.2:

- **Config hardening.** Multisig/timelock on the setter entitlement, or pushing more fields toward immutability; fully-immutable redeploy-only may require self-replenishing funding to be practical.
- **Self-replenishing funding.** Fee top-ups sourced from a vault-level fee buffer or treasury sweep rather than admin out-of-band top-ups.

If business logic ever moves to Cadence, the failure model fundamentally changes. The principle worth preserving: split scheduling and business logic into separate scheduled transactions, so a panic in the work doesn't take down the rescheduling loop.
